# Kivy Example: Hello World

This directory contains two versions of the Hello World application:
* `helloworld.py` programmatically creates widgets to display text on the screen
* `helloworld_kvlang.py` and `helloworldkv.kv` use the KV language to display text on the screen

This example is derived from [YingLiu4203's Hello World Application example](https://github.com/YingLiu4203/LearningKivy/blob/master/Ch02%20Hello%20World/The%20Hello%20World%20Application.md). The [Kivy Programming Guide also has this example](https://kivy.org/docs/guide/basic.html) also has this example.
