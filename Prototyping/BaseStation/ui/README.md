## UI Dependencies

MUST inherit from:
QWidget, QHBoxLayout, or QVBoxLayout

This allows for easy addition to the main UI framework.

## Extra features

Modular design should allow for a standalone runner file to operate each component of the UI outside of the framework
If this is not possible, the dependency has not been written properly.
