Comms: (Will, Nick, Ryan)
    Design packets (use Python structs)
        - Drive to Rover
        - GPS to Rover
        - sensors back
    Get comms working

Autonomous:
    heading between two GPS coords - Elizabeth
    GPS - Sebastian
    Mag problems
        - average last 10?
        - calc heading of front based on Pot reading
    Obstacle avoidance - Albert and Benton
        - distance sensor - science team
        - design algorithm - Albert and Benton
        - keep a map of known obstacles?
    Encoders (EE motor controller will feed us rotations speeds)


For large Rover:
    Motor-controllers - Brian and Justin

Arm
    put inverse kinematics on Beaglebone - Ethan
    comms for arm
